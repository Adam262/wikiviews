## Grow Therapy Platform Engineering Take-Home

This programming project is meant to gauge back-end web app development skills, ability to
use third-party APIs, and ability to use containers.

### Project Requirements

This exercise involves creating a containerized back-end web application:

- Back-end web application that acts as a wrapper around the Wikipedia API. The
application should expose an endpoint that returns the view count for a given article for a
given month.
- The application does not need a front-end.
- We recommend using a mainstream language and web framework, e.g. TypeScript/Node/Express, Python/Flask, Java/Spring.
- The application should use communicate with the Wikipedia API directly and not use a third-party package, e.g. python-mviews
- Application is containerized using Docker
- Feel free to use additional wrappers around `docker`, e.g. a Makefile

## Tips for a Great Take Home

- Add a README file
- Document your API endpoint
- Write tests for your application
- Make it easy for our team to build and run your application locally
- Utilize best practices for containerization and Docker
- Think through how you would want to handle corner cases and invalid requests
- Think through performance, security, and reliability implications including what you would want to do in Production
